Title: Agile Bot Orchestrator for JIRA Issue Resolution

Description:
The Agile Bot Orchestrator is a revolutionary project designed to streamline and automate the resolution of issues within JIRA using advanced GPT-4 bots. This innovative solution adopts an Agile methodology, employing multiple specialized bots to assume various roles typically found within a software development team. Each bot is designated a specific function—ranging from issue analysis, Gherkin scenario formulation, to solution development and testing—mimicking a collaborative environment where these bots interact as if they were team members in a room discussing and tackling the problem at hand.

The core of this project lies in its ability to transform conventional JIRA issues into well-defined Gherkin scenarios, adhering to the principles of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). This approach not only enhances the clarity and comprehensibility of requirements but also facilitates more efficient and effective test-driven solution development.

Upon resolving an issue, the bots generate the necessary output files, which are then seamlessly deployed to Heroku for hosting. This end-to-end automation not only significantly reduces the turnaround time for issue resolution but also ensures consistency and quality in the solutions provided. The Agile Bot Orchestrator embodies the next leap in agile project management and software development, promising a future where bots and humans collaborate more closely for faster, more efficient outcomes.

Once a requirement is updated on the UI the jiras will be created and then each jira issue will trigger a webhook to run a flask app which will pick all the information from the jira issue and
generate gherkin scenarios to be then executed to solve the requirement. These scenarios will be executed with our speciallly tune gpt4 agents who are in an advanced and controlled room which 
will solve the issues and create and push the code to git repo. this code will be then with assistance of...
An OpenAI function in the B&W autogen chat designed to manage Git operations with assistance from Aider.
A GitHub Actions setup that automatically triggers a pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
Integration of a language server parser (LSP) to enhance code editing and debugging capabilities.
Implementation of the Pytree-sitter library from Aider for efficient syntax parsing in Python projects.

The project offers a robust solution to common software engineering challenges with its cutting-edge, highly automated strategy. By leveraging artificial intelligence as the core decision-making tool, it not only adheres to the principles of behavior-driven development but also significantly reduces human intervention, thereby boosting efficiency.
 Studies reveal that developers expend between 23% and 42% of their time grappling with technical debt, suboptimal code, and inadequate documentation. In contrast, tools like GitHub Copilot have been shown to enhance coding speed by 55%, boost productivity by 88%, and accelerate repetitive tasks by 96%. Our project harnesses GeneAI to write high-quality code, craft comprehensive documentation, and streamline CI/CD processes, dramatically improving developer efficiency and outcomes. Aligned with the go/2024emergingtrends, this solution effectively replicates the work of a team of junior developers using advanced AI agents. This product not only minimizes human labor but also significantly reduces costs by automating the entire orchestration and DevOps processes. It’s a transformative approach to software development, promising substantial efficiency gains and cost savings.

The effective execution of our project requires a comprehensive set of technical skills. Key among these are expertise in Large Language Models (LLMs) for advanced AI-driven functionalities. Familiarity with Jira is important for effective project management and tracking. Additionally, proficiency in CI/CD practices and GitHub Actions is essential for implementing robust automation within our development pipelines. Knowledge of AI agents is also crucial, enabling the automation of complex software development tasks. Together, these skills are vital for navigating and excelling in the project's demands.

Project Title: ProActiveGuard: AI-Powered Bug Prediction & Risk Mitigation

Project Description (less than 1000 characters): ProActiveGuard leverages large language models (LLMs) trained on production release data, code bases, past bugs, and incidents to predict upcoming bugs, identify potential risks, and prevent incidents before future releases and commits. Integrated into pull requests, it utilizes GPT agents and shell tools for seamless implementation.

Project Benefit (less than 1000 characters): ProActiveGuard minimizes software bugs, reduces risks, and enhances release stability by proactively identifying potential issues and preventing incidents before they occur. This leads to improved product quality, higher customer satisfaction, and increased development efficiency.


In modern software development, identifying bugs and potential incidents before deploying code into production is a challenging and time-consuming task. Traditional testing methods often fail to catch all possible issues, leading to post-release bugs and unforeseen incidents that can disrupt operations and damage reputation. Moreover, with the increasing complexity of software systems, manually reviewing code for bugs and potential incidents becomes increasingly inefficient and prone to human error.


Abstract (5000 characters): ProActiveGuard revolutionizes software development by harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) to predict and prevent bugs, risks, and incidents before they impact production environments. By analyzing historical production release data, code bases, past bugs, and incidents, ProActiveGuard trains LLMs to understand the complex relationships between code changes and potential issues. These models are continuously updated with the latest code base to ensure accuracy and relevance.

During the development process, ProActiveGuard seamlessly integrates into the workflow, providing real-time feedback and warnings within pull requests. Using GPT agents and shell tools, developers can easily access insights and recommendations to address potential risks and vulnerabilities before they are deployed.
