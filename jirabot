Title: Agile Bot Orchestrator for JIRA Issue Resolution

Description:
The Agile Bot Orchestrator is a revolutionary project designed to streamline and automate the resolution of issues within JIRA using advanced GPT-4 bots. This innovative solution adopts an Agile methodology, employing multiple specialized bots to assume various roles typically found within a software development team. Each bot is designated a specific function—ranging from issue analysis, Gherkin scenario formulation, to solution development and testing—mimicking a collaborative environment where these bots interact as if they were team members in a room discussing and tackling the problem at hand.

The core of this project lies in its ability to transform conventional JIRA issues into well-defined Gherkin scenarios, adhering to the principles of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). This approach not only enhances the clarity and comprehensibility of requirements but also facilitates more efficient and effective test-driven solution development.

Upon resolving an issue, the bots generate the necessary output files, which are then seamlessly deployed to Heroku for hosting. This end-to-end automation not only significantly reduces the turnaround time for issue resolution but also ensures consistency and quality in the solutions provided. The Agile Bot Orchestrator embodies the next leap in agile project management and software development, promising a future where bots and humans collaborate more closely for faster, more efficient outcomes.

Once a requirement is updated on the UI the jiras will be created and then each jira issue will trigger a webhook to run a flask app which will pick all the information from the jira issue and
generate gherkin scenarios to be then executed to solve the requirement. These scenarios will be executed with our speciallly tune gpt4 agents who are in an advanced and controlled room which 
will solve the issues and create and push the code to git repo. this code will be then with assistance of...
An OpenAI function in the B&W autogen chat designed to manage Git operations with assistance from Aider.

The project offers a robust solution to common software engineering challenges with its cutting-edge, highly automated strategy. By leveraging artificial intelligence as the core decision-making tool, it not only adheres to the principles of behavior-driven development but also significantly reduces human intervention, thereby boosting efficiency.
 Studies reveal that developers expend between 23% and 42% of their time grappling with technical debt, suboptimal code, and inadequate documentation. In contrast, tools like GitHub Copilot have been shown to enhance coding speed by 55%, boost productivity by 88%, and accelerate repetitive tasks by 96%. Our project harnesses GeneAI to write high-quality code, craft comprehensive documentation, and streamline CI/CD processes, dramatically improving developer efficiency and outcomes. Aligned with the go/2024emergingtrends, this solution effectively replicates the work of a team of junior developers using advanced AI agents. This product not only minimizes human labor but also significantly reduces costs by automating the entire orchestration and DevOps processes. It’s a transformative approach to software development, promising substantial efficiency gains and cost savings.

The effective execution of our project requires a comprehensive set of technical skills. Key among these are expertise in Large Language Models (LLMs) for advanced AI-driven functionalities. Familiarity with Jira is important for effective project management and tracking. Additionally, proficiency in CI/CD practices and GitHub Actions is essential for implementing robust automation within our development pipelines. Knowledge of AI agents is also crucial, enabling the automation of complex software development tasks. Together, these skills are vital for navigating and excelling in the project's demands.
