Title: Agile Bot Orchestrator for JIRA Issue Resolution

Description:
The Agile Bot Orchestrator is a revolutionary project designed to streamline and automate the resolution of issues within JIRA using advanced GPT-4 bots. This innovative solution adopts an Agile methodology, employing multiple specialized bots to assume various roles typically found within a software development team. Each bot is designated a specific function—ranging from issue analysis, Gherkin scenario formulation, to solution development and testing—mimicking a collaborative environment where these bots interact as if they were team members in a room discussing and tackling the problem at hand.

The core of this project lies in its ability to transform conventional JIRA issues into well-defined Gherkin scenarios, adhering to the principles of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). This approach not only enhances the clarity and comprehensibility of requirements but also facilitates more efficient and effective test-driven solution development.

Upon resolving an issue, the bots generate the necessary output files, which are then seamlessly deployed to Heroku for hosting. This end-to-end automation not only significantly reduces the turnaround time for issue resolution but also ensures consistency and quality in the solutions provided. The Agile Bot Orchestrator embodies the next leap in agile project management and software development, promising a future where bots and humans collaborate more closely for faster, more efficient outcomes.

Once a requirement is updated on the UI the jiras will be created and then each jira issue will trigger a webhook to run a flask app which will pick all the information from the jira issue and
generate gherkin scenarios to be then executed to solve the requirement. These scenarios will be executed with our speciallly tune gpt4 agents who are in an advanced and controlled room which 
will solve the issues and create and push the code to git repo. this code will be then with assistance of...
